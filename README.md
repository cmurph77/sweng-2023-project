To run the project you need to run the api and frontend on seperate ports locally

Step 1: you will need to host the api first so it launches on port 3000
    1. run the command 'cd api' to move into api directory
    2. Follow instructions in readme on how to host api

Step 2: you then need to host the front end
    1. run the command 'cd frontend' to move into api directory 
    2. run 'npm install' to install correct dependencies
    3. run 'npm start' to start the server
    4. you will be prompted to change the port as the api should already ne running on port 3000, in this case just select 'Y'
